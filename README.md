- 👋 Hi, I’m Mehmet, participant @PowerCoders..
- I'm deeply passionate about IT and have embarked on an exciting journey of continuous learning and exploration since 2018.
My fascination with technology led me to dive into a wide array of programming languages, including Python, Linux, SQL, HTML, and CSS, laying the foundation for my diverse IT career. The pivotal point came when I immersed myself in a rigorous 9-month training program focused on AWS Cloud and DevOps Engineering. This experience opened doors to a world of possibilities. I've further honed my skills continuously, and my thirst for knowledge has led me to the University of Geneva, where I've completed various IT courses, covering Software Development Methodologies - Docker & Kubernetes, Data Visualization, and Applied Data Science.
- 👀 I’m interested in Developing, using empowering Cloud Services and amazing DevOps tools.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning front-end.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on automation.
- 📫 you can reach me on my website https://mehmetavci.ch/
